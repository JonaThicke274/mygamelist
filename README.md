# My Game List

## Purpose/Use of Application
This application's purpose is to allow a user to search a video game by it's title, developer, publisher, and/or description. If a user is logged in and/or signed up, they can save games to their account to refer back to them later as well give them a rating/review. If a user would no longer like to refer back to a particular video game, they can delete the game from their account. Users will also be able to edit/adjust their ratings for games as well.
